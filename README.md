## Welcome to David's CV

A quick hello to tell you a bit about me with more detail available on [my linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dleyden/). Looking to make the transition from construction project management into the world of tech.

I have a career-long record of delivering products and services that surpass customer expectations by continually balancing creative, user-centric solutions (from stadium design to data analytics tools) with commercial and strategic imperatives across a range of industries. As a big picture focused, optimistic and driven individual, I enjoy roles within cultures where change is embraced for the potential it can bring and great people are encouraged to work together to solve complex and interesting customer problems
